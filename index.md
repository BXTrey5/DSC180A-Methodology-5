**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain is learning and understanding the Gaussian Process models since this is something that has not really been covered in previous data science courses.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
One potential investigation I would like to pursue is to look more into the other models discussed outside of the CNN I implemented. The Gaussian Process and Random Forest model can help us with our quarter 2 task and maybe be improved or incorporated in our new task.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
The main approach I would change is to work more collaboratively with my group. Throughout the quarter, a lot of the work has been divided, and in quarter 2, the tasks may still be divided, but we can still work more collaboratively and have open discussions about our project. I would like to find time to discuss approaches and tasks with each other more often throughout the week.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I hope to employ more visualization techniques beyond the plots of the outputs and emissions in different areas of the world. Creating plots that give more insights about how the data is distributed and related would improve the project.
